>> % Basic mathematical expressions
>> %MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a fourth-generation high-level programming language and interactive environment
%It is used for:
%Programming - The reason behind engineers using MATLAB!
%Numerical computation - That’s why the science enthusiasts are on MATLAB!
%Data Visualization - Well, today everyone needs Data Visualisation especially the Economics and Commerce experts!
>> %Signal Processing is one of the most widely used applications of MATLAB
>> %Robotics researchers and engineers use MATLAB to design and tune algorithms, model real-world systems, and automatically generate code - all from one software environment.
>> %Using MATLAB®, engineers and other domain experts have deployed thousands of machine learning applications. MATLAB makes the hard parts of machine learning easy
>> %Data Science:
%MATLAB has inbuilt tools with which you can quickly visualize your data to understand trends and identify data quality issues with plots and the Live Editor
%Data Visualization is the primary step that is required in Data Science!
>> % MATLAB is not a freeware application
>> %In order to create and execute a program, the MATLAB editor is used!
>> %Once the editor is launched select “Text” to start entering your text
